### Integration via RESTful interactions
See all the supported RESTful interactions per resource on the [SAP help portal](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f5035f472fff4b39bce8e6abb0e62288/618.21/en-US/2bd62213ae224f0091fc982ffcb5018a.html). 

If you have not activated the FHIR interface in your IS-H system yet, have a look at the capability statement for SP27 [here](https://simplifier.net/fhirapiofsappatientmanagementis-h/5ef3fd39-0377-1ed9-9ce0-bb0a77809049).

Note: it is a know issue that Simplifier cannot render the messaging part of the capability Statement, therefore you'll only be able to see the REST part.
