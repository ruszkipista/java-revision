class Facade_pattern {
/*
Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, 
or any other complex set of classes.
A facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains
lots of moving parts. A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with
the subsystem directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about.

Facade defines a new interface for existing objects, whereas Adapter tries to make the existing
interface usable. Adapter usually wraps just one object, while Facade works with an entire
subsystem of objects.

A Facade class can often be transformed into a Singleton
since a single facade object is sufficient in most cases.
